            <h3>World-class professional web developer</h3>
            <p>Coding professionals are in high demand. For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects software developer jobs to grow by 25% from 2021-2031. And the BLS projects jobs for data scientists to grow by 36% during the same time. These projections exceed the average 5% growth for all U.S. jobs.

Fortunately, you can display your knowledge and skills and differentiate yourself from others with projects you've done in school, as a volunteer, or just for your dream job.
